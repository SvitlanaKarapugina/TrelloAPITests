# TrelloAPITests
API tests for testing Trello using cucumber and rest assured. Just example with 2 tests
Tests:
- Get boards list
- Create new Board with static name, if board with such name exists we delete board and create new one.

I used GET, POST request. For using this project you need to update constants: key, token, member_id.
